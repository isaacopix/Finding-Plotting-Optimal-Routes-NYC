Finding & Plotting Optimal Routes in NYC
Overview

This notebook is designed to compute and visualize the most efficient travel routes in New York City. The application achieves this by mapping geo nodes from Open Source Routing Machine API to geographic database 

and applying route optimization algorithms to provide users with detailed insights into transportation paths, distances, and travel times within the NYC area.

Key Features

Route Optimization: Calculates the shortest or fastest paths between a set of origin and destination points using geographic data.

Data Visualization: Visualizes the computed routes on a map using libraries like matplotlib or folium.

Geospatial Analysis: Employs geospatial data processing techniques to evaluate and manipulate NYC road networks.

Modular Code Design: The notebook is organized into sections for easy comprehension and extension.
